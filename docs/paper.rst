About the paper
===============

The methodology implemented in *OptiWindNet* is described in a paper submitted to the *European Journal of Operational Research* (undergoing peer review). The paper is titled **"Flexible cable routing framework for wind farm collection system optimization"** and was written by *Mauricio Souza de Alencar*, *Tuhfe Göçmen* and *Nicolaos A. Cutululis*.

The computational experiments presented on that paper can be reproduced with the code published in this section. Alternatively, the notebooks (40 series), along with the required *data* folder, can be `downloaded here <https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/OptiWindNet/-/tree/main/docs/notebooks/>`_.

**Note**: many of the jupyter notebooks provided here have SVG figures as cell outputs, which will only be displayed by JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook if the notebook is marked as trusted (In JupyterLab: ``Ctrl+Shift+C`` -> Trust Notebook).
