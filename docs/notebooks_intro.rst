Overview
========

The documentation consists of a series of jupyter notebooks, which can be viewed online or executed on the cloud or on a personal computer with `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/install>`_ (JupyterLab recommended).

**Note**: many of the jupyter notebooks provided here have SVG figures as cell outputs, which will only be displayed by JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook if the notebook is marked as trusted (In JupyterLab: ``Ctrl+Shift+C`` -> Trust Notebook).
