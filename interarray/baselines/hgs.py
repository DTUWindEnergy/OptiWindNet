    '''Wrapper for PyHygese module, which provides bindings to the HGS-CVRP
    library (Hybrid Genetic Search solver for Capacitated Vehicle Routing
    Problems).

    Normalization of input graph is recommended before calling this function.

    Arguments:
        `A`: graph with allowed edges (if it has 0 edges, use complete graph)
        `capacity`: maximum vehicle capacity
        `time_limit`: [s] solver run time limit
        `scale`: factor to scale lengths
        `vehicles`: number of vehicles (if None, use the minimum feasible)
